## Description
- This website was designed to educate, inform, and instruct end-users in the world of Search Engine Optimization, Social Media, and Marketing. In addition, it briefly highlights the benefits of each and how they can help level-up the end-users website in the world of algorythms. 

- This was part of an assignment given to my class and I to help us apply what we had learned about HTML, CSS, and integrating the two together to build and upload a website through Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
